        The Bakweri speak Mokpwe, a tongue that is closely related to Bakole and Wumboko. Mokpwe is part of the family of Duala languages in the Bantu group of the Niger–Congo language phylum. Neighbouring peoples often utilise Mokpwe as a trade language, due largely to the spread of the tongue by early missionaries. This is particularly true among the Isubu, many of whom are bilingual in Duala or Mokpwe.
        <br /><br />
        In addition, individuals who have attended school or lived in an urban centre usually speak Pidgin English or standard English. A growing number of the Bakweri today grow up with Pidgin as a more widely spoken language. The Bakweri also used a drum language to convey news from clan to clan, and they also utilized a horn language peculiar to them.
 The Mokpe Alphabet is similar to that of English with the exception of three strange characters, which will be brought to you later. There are 21 consonants and 7 vowels. <br /><br /> Here below is the Mokpe alphabet.

       The 21 consonants have the same sounds as in English, but four of them pose a problem of pronunciation to young speakers and writers of the Mokpe language.<br />
They are f, s, v and w. Follow the description below very carefully.<br /><br />

"f"<br />
In English the letter 'f' is a labio-dental fricative that is you use the lips and teeth to produce this sound, In Mokpe it is a bilabial fricative where you use both lips there by producing a sound as if you were blowing out a candle.
<br />
Practise sounding it several times.<br />
Ff Ff  Ff Ff<br /><br />

“s”<br />
To produce the Mokpe 's' place the tip of tongue on the hard palate and let out the slowly producing a soft hissing sound, close the English 's'
<br /><br />
Ss Ss  Ss Ss Ss<br />

'v' is produced using both lips, instead of placing the bottom lip on the Teeth as case in English. The letter 'w' is the same as in English, rounding both lips. Practise these two sounds and discover the difference.
