    <p>The Bakweri still practice arts and crafts handed down for generations. The Bakweri are known to be skilled weavers of hats and shirts, for example. They also construct armoires, chairs, and tables.
Bakweri dances serve a number of purposes. The Bakweri Male Dance, for example, demonstrates the performers' virility. Other dances are purely for enjoyment, such as the maringa and the ashiko, which arose in the 1930s, and the makossa and ambasse bey dances that accompany those musical styles.
The greatest venue for Bakweri music and dance are the two major festivals that take place each year in December. The Ngondo is a traditional festival of the Duala, although today all of Cameroon's coastal Sawa peoples are invited to participate. It originated as a means of training Duala children the skills of warfare. Now, however, the main focus is on communicating with the ancestors and asking them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, beauty pageants, pirogue races, and traditional wrestling.
The Mpo'o brings together the Bakoko, Bakweri, and Limba at Edéa. The festival commemorates the ancestors and allows the participants to consider the problems facing the groups and humanity as a whole. Lively music, dancing, theatre, and recitals accompany the celebration.

<b>Marriage rituals and practices</b> <br />
It is the father who pays the dowry, because the young man is not working and the father is supposed to own goods therefore, he is the one who pays. After fulfilling the requirement, it is the man who decides on when to take the wife. The day of that occasion you bring the big and the girls’ family will assess you on what to pay. The father of the girl will start the biting on the price of the dowry from 1million, until the two families reach at 500000FCFA, which is usually the lowest amount they can accept. Sometimes, the two families may come to a compromise and ask the groom to give what he has. If you don’t kill a pig you are not fully married, the bakweri don’t usually issue marriage certificate. After paying part of the dowry, that is when you are officially married. On the marriage day, the girl’s family brings the bride to the man’s family. The ceremony is celebrated, on after the ceremony, the bride and the groom’s family prepare a nice bed with a white bed sheet on which the bride is expected to bleed, as a sign of her virginity. If the woman bleeds on the sheet, then she is a good bride, if not, she might be disregarded by her groom and the groom’s family.

<b>Inheritance or kinship patterns</b> <br />
Bakweri inheritance is patrilineal; upon the father’s death, his property is inherited by his eldest son. Inheritance also depends on the behaviour of the children. If a child is a chief or is very stubborn or is noted for a very bad character like arrogance to the elders, or disregard to the tradition, the father can decide to give his inheritance to the brother. Also, if the father dies when the children are still very young, the inheritance can be transferred to a family member who is trust worthy. Also, the next of king does not necessarily means that all the property belongs to you, you are the one to control the property. If you are not from the royal family, you cannot be made a king. King makers are people who come from the chief family. Notables and are the people who decides on the next king after the initial king has made his will. Furthermore, we call “Manawondja”, when a woman is not married and have attained an age when she can no longer get married then she can have a voice in the family.
